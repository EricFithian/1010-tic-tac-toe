In order to create your own Github Repo:

1. git init 
This initializes Git 
2. Create a repo in Github
3. git remote add origin (url)
4. git add .
5. git commit -m "Message"
6. git push origin (branch)

Keyboard shortcuts:

1. To highlight things that are the same and write on multiple rows
at the same time, use command & D at the same time
2. To copy a row, or several rows, use shift & option & up or
down to copy it either right above or below
3. Option up moves code up a line, option down moves it down a line

MVP:
1. Start with minimal HTML/CSS and focus on the easiest
JS portions first to meet requirements!!
2. Once you're through an MVP, you get to choose what would
be the coolest next feature you want to improve. 

Other notes:
1. Template literals, using the back tick (right under the esc 
button in the upper left corner) is worth looking into for writing
cleaner console.logs and other items
